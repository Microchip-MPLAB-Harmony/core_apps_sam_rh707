# FAT filesystem using SDSPI Media

This application shows an example of using the MPLAB Harmony File System to access and modify the contents of a SD card using the SDSPI driver and the SPI PLIB

## Description

### File System Operations on the SD Card:

- Application opens a file named **FILE_TOO_LONG_NAME_EXAMPLE_123.JPG** in the root directory of the SD card and reads its content into memory
    - The image file could be any arbitrary JPEG (image) file chosen by the user and then renamed to **FILE_TOO_LONG_NAME_EXAMPLE_123.JPG**
- Application creates directory named **Dir1** in the root directory
- Application creates a new file named **FILE_TOO_LONG_NAME_EXAMPLE_123.JPG** inside **Dir1**
- Application copies the content from step 1 into this newly created file

The reason for choosing a JPEG file for test purposes is that the duplicate file, **Dir1/FILE_TOO_LONG_NAME_EXAMPLE_123.JPG** created by the demonstration could be easily verified for correctness.If the new file inside **Dir1** opens for viewing on the computer and matches to original image, the test is deemed to have passed. Otherwise, if the file does not open (i.e., is corrupted), the test will be considered to have failed.

### Note:

*Since the application creates a directory named Dir1, it is important that the a folder with the same name does not exist on the SD card. If a directory named Dir1 is already present on the SD card, the application will fail.*

### File system layer uses:

- SDSPI Driver to communicate to SD Card over SPI interface.

## Setting up the hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

| Project Name| Board|
|:---------|:---------:|
| sam_rh707_ek.X | [SAM RH707 Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/SAMRH707F18-EK) |

### Setting up [SAM RH707 Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/SAMRH707F18-EK)

- To run the demo, the following additional hardware are required:
  - One [IO1 Xplained Pro Extension Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATIO1-XPRO)
  - One micro-sd card

- Connect [IO1 Xplained Pro Extension Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATIO1-XPRO) to the J18 connector
- Insert the micro-SD Card in the micro-SD Card slot of the [IO1 Xplained Pro Extension Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATIO1-XPRO)
- Connect the debugger probe to J5 connector
- Connect the J1 (USB-C) port on the board to the computer using a USB-C cable

## Running the Application

1. Build and program the application using its IDE
2. Press Switch to start the file operations
3. The LED is turned ON if there was no error during creating the directory and copying the file into it

Refer to the following table for switch and LED name:

| Board | Switch name | LED Name |
| ----- | -------- | --------- |
|  [SAM RH707 Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/SAMRH707F18-EK) | PB0 | LED0 |
|||

4. If LED is ON, Insert the SD Card on to your host PC
5. SD Card should have the file **Dir1/FILE_TOO_LONG_NAME_EXAMPLE_123.JPG** and should match the original image
